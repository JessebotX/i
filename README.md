**NOTE: This website is a work in progress**

This is the source code for my personal website/gemini capsule. You can find the
website at `https://usernamesystems.xyz`[[1][1]] and the gemini capsule at
`gemini://usernamesystems.xyz`[[2][2]].

I've written tools to facilitate writing my website in markdown, which gets
convert to both HTML (for http[s] websites) and gemtext (for gemini capsules)

1. [https://usernamesystems.xyz][1]
2. [gemini://usernamesystems.xyz][2]

[1]: https://usernamesystems.xyz
[2]: gemini://usernamesystems.xyz

Development
-----------
I have written the site in a way that allows anyone to view the content of my
site without any webserver running.

What's a Gemini Capsule?
------------------------
A gemini capsule is a non-http[s] "website", similar to the old protocol Gopher.
Unlike the web, gemini capsules are MUCH simpler and lighter as there are no XML
skyscrapers, site-specific styling and javascript frameworks. It's all just
plain text markup inspired by Markdown. This gives the user and app developer
control over the looks of capsules and makes the content more accessible and as
the user can easily browse the content on almost every platform from black and
white text terminals to modern GUI applications.

This site has mostly been written in Markdown, which allows me to easily produce
content and have it mirrored to both the HTTP/s and gemini protocol.
